# Event Notifications solution

This solution supports the following:
- Creating a new resource group, or taking in an existing one.
- Provisioning and configuring an Event Notifications instance.
- Configuring KMS encryption using an existing root key, or optionally creating a new key ring and Key in an existing instance.

**NB:** This solution is not intended to be called by one or more other modules since it contains a provider configurations, meaning it is not compatible with the `for_each`, `count`, and `depends_on` arguments.
